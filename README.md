PHP & Frontend Technical Test

Introduction
---
Congratulations on being selected to complete the Sky Betting & Gaming Technical Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions - we want to see well thought-out and well structured code.


The Brief
---
The aim of the test is to produce a system capable of loading, modifying and saving some data using PHP, HTML and JS. You should use best足practices where appropriate, ensuring that you separate your presentation and logic and that your code is modular where possible.

You should fork this repository, commit your files, then submit pull requests as your submission.

Step 1 足 MVC Form Handler
---

Make a simple MVC application from scratch to process posted form data, saving it to file and reading it back out again in order to update the records.

* Make a branch named 'step1'
* The application structure is of your choosing, and the entities should be modelled appropriately
* The markup is provided at the end of this document and, as it stands, doesn't submit to anywhere; use it to create your view
* For storage you should write the data in php serialized format to 'data.ser' or similar on disk
* The form fields should be repopulated from that data file when the page loads or following a Save operation

To complete this step extend your system to support a new 'jobtitle' field, which will be populated for at least some of the records.

Add appropriate unit tests using phpunit.

Step 2 足 Asynchronous Loading and Saving
---

The brief for this step is to replicate the functionality of Step 1, but achieve the load and save operations asynchronously from the browser, transferring a JSON structure to represent the data back to the server.

* Make a new branch named 'step2' - branched from 'step1' above
* You should aim to use php://input to receive the post data
* For the client side element you can use your own Javascript or base it on an open source framework
* Develop the code for a modern browser of your choice and let us know what it has been tested in


Implementation Notes
---

* Use of PHP frameworks is discouraged
* Use of a frontend Javascript framework is allowed
* Using composer for autoloading, tactical libraries & phpunit is allowed

Don't worry if you don't finish all of the steps, we're more interested in how you implement the steps which you do complete as they give us more insight into how good you are as a developer.

Remember to *Sell Yourself*!


Appendix 足 Form Markup
---

An example of the initial HTML form is below. You may choose to use this if you wish.

```html
<form>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>First name</th>
            <th>Last name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][firstname]" value="Leonard" /></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][surname]" value="Hofstader" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][firstname]" value="Sheldon" /></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][surname]" value="Cooper" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][firstname]" value="Raj" /></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][surname]" value="Koothrapali" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][firstname]" value="Howard" /></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][surname]" value="Wolowitz" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][firstname]" value="Penny" /></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="people[][surname]" value="" /></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <input type="submit" value="OK" />
</form>
```
